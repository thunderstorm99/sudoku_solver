# sudoku_solver

This is an evening project I had in mind.

It either shows off its abilities with a pre-programmed Sudoku-puzzle or lets you put in your own Sudoku and solves it for you.
I was first planning on using Go but switched to Python for simplicity's sake. Maybe I will finish the Go version later on.
